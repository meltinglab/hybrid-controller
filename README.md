# Hybrid controller 
CoDeAS a.y. 2020/2021

## Description
This repository contains a MATLAB - Simulink project about the Model Based Design of a controller for a PHEV. The objective is to implement a control strategy for the allocation of the acceleration demanded by the driver to the IC engine and electric motor, depending on the current state of the vehicle, battery charge and fuel level. Similarly, the controller is in charge of managing the repartition of the braking demand between the regenerative braking and standard braking. 

## Installation
Clone the code or download the ZIP file. Open the MATLAB project file `Hybrid-controller/HybridController.prj`

Note: MATLAB R2020b may be required.

## Usage
The Simulink model `Hybrid-controller/Simulation/HybridVehicle.slx` contains the PHEV plant in which as been integrated the controller. The default drive cycle is the WLTP Class 3.
